# IoT_Project_Semester4
Continuous assessment Project for IoT Standards and Protocols.

## Medical Temperature Moniter (MTM)
`Student Name:` Mark Bates
`Student ID:` 20088639

## Project Description

For this project, i wish to build off what i did in my previous IoT project from last year, being the "Decibal Detector" that monitered audio and temperature levels. This project however will run solely on the Raspberry Pi and not on an arduino. The Pi will detect Temperature and Humidity, which will be sent to a cloud based application. If the temperarure dips or rises from a specified margin, it will react by sending a notification to the user.
The plan is to make this a medical based application prototype that can be hypothetically used in hospital rooms to moniter patients or freezers for vaccine environment control.

## Tools, Tech and Equipment
To get a working prototype of my proposed project, i will need:
- **Raspberry Pi**
- **Sense Hat**
- (other hardware may be necessary)

---

This project will be coded using:
- **Python**
- (other coding languages may be used)

Cloud technologies such as **Thingspeak** or similar may also be implemented
